                    Augmented Reality (AR) is a perfect blend of the digital world and the physical elements to create an artificial environment. Apps which are developed using AR technology for mobile or desktop to blend digital components into the real world. The full form of AR is Augment Reality.
                    Example: AR technology helps to display score overlays on telecasted sports games and pop out 3D photos, text messages, and emails.
                    
                    
                    <H4>What is Virtual Reality (VR)?</H4>
                    Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer-generated simulation of an alternate world or reality. It is used in 3D movies and video games. It helps to create simulations similar to the real world and “immerse” the viewer using computers and sensory devices like headsets and gloves.
                    Apart from games and entertainment, virtual reality is also used for training, education, and science. The full form of VR is Virtual reality
                    
                    
                    <H4>How does AR works?</H4>
                    AR uses computer vision, mapping as well as depth tracking in order to show appropriate content to the user. This functionality allows cameras to collect, send, and process data to show digital content appropriate to what any user is looking at.
                    In Augmented reality, the user’s physical environment is enhanced with contextually relevant digital content in real-time. You can experience (AR) augmented reality with a smartphone or with special hardware.
                    
                    <H4>How does VR works?</H4>
The focus of virtual reality is on simulating the vision. The user needs to put a VR headset screen in front of his/her eyes. Therefore, eliminating any interaction with the real world. In VR, two lenses are placed between the screen. The user needs to adjust eyes based on the individual movement of the eye and its positioning. The visuals on the screen can be rendered by using an HDMI cable connected to a PC or mobile phone.
Uses goggles, speakers, and sometimes handheld wearables to simulate a real-world experience. In virtual reality, you can also employ visual, auditory, and haptic (touch) stimulation, so the constructed reality is immersive.

                    <H5>Here are the pros/benefits of Augmented Reality:</H5>
                    * Offers individualized learning
                    * Fostering the learning process
                    * Wide variety of fields
                    * Offers innovation and continuous improvement
                    * Increase accuracy
                    * Augmented reality can be used to increase user knowledge and information.
                    * People can share experiences over long distances.
                    * Helps developers to build games that offer “real” experience to the user.
                    
                    
                    <H4>Advantages of Virtual Reality (VR)</H4>
                    <H5>Here are the pros/benefits of Virtual Reality:</H5>
                    * Immersive learning
                    * Create an interactive environment
                    * Increase work capabilities
                    * Offer convenience
                    * One of the most important advantages of VR is that it helps you to create a realistic world so that the user can explore the world.
                    * Virtual reality in the education field makes education more easy and comfortable.

                <li><i class="bi bi-check-circle"></i> <H4>Disadvantages of Augmented Reality</H4>
                    <H5>Here are the cons/drawbacks of Augmented Reality:</H5>
                    * It is very expensive to implement and develop AR technology-based projects and to maintain it.
                    * Lack of privacy is a major drawback of AR.
                    * The low-performance level of AR devices is a major drawback that can arise during the testing phase.
                    * Augmented reality can cause mental health issues.
                    * Lack of security may affect the overall augmented reality principle.
                    * Extreme engagement with AR technology can lead to major healthcare issues such as eye problems and obesity etc.
                    
                    
                   <H4> Disadvantages of Virtual Reality</H4>
                    <H5>Here are the cons/drawbacks of Virtual Reality:</H5>
                    * VR is becoming much more common, but programmers will never be able to interact with virtual environments.
                    * The escapism is commonplace among those that use VR environments, and people start living in the virtual world instead of dealing with real-world issues.
                    * Training with a VR environment never has the same result as training and working in the real world. This means if somebody done well with simulated tasks in a VR environment, there is still no guarantee that a person doing well in the real world.

                    <H5>Here are the important applications of AR technology:</H5>
                    * AR apps are being developed which iframe text, images, videos, etc.
                    * Printing and advertising industries are using AR technology apps to display digital content on top of real-world magazines.
                    * AR technology allows you for the development of translation apps that helps you to interpret the text in other languages for you.
                    * With the help of the Unity 3d Engine tool, AR is being used to develop real-time 3D Games.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    <H4>Applications of Virtual Reality (VR)</H4>
                    <H5>Here are the important applications of VR:</H5>
                    * VR technology is used to build and enhance a fictional reality for the gaming world.
                    * VR can use by the military for flight simulations, battlefield simulations, etc.
                    * VR is used as a digital training device in many sports and to help to measure a sports person’s performance and analyze their techniques.
                    * It is also becoming a primary method for treating post-traumatic stress.
                    * Using VR devices such as Google Cardboard, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or users can be transported into real-world and imagined environments like squawking penguin colony or even the back of a dragon.
                    * VR technology offers a safe environment for patients to come into contact with things they fear.
                    * Medical students use VR to practice and procedures
                    * Virtual patients are used to help students to develop skills that can later be applied in the real world. </li>

                    <H5>How AR and VR work together?</H5>
                    It will be wrong to convey that Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality are intended to operate separately. They mostly blended together to generate an improved engaging experience when these technologies are merged together to transport the user to the fictitious world by giving a new dimension of interaction between the real and virtual world.
